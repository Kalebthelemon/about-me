I’m **Kaleb Lemmons** (*seploss*), a 16-year-old from Arkansas learning cybersecurity while running labs on TryHackMe and exploring penetration testing.

**Tech Focus:** Security+ fundamentals — encryption, networking, PKI — plus Bash/Zsh scripting, Wireshark analysis, and basic networking setup.  
**Music Focus:** Rod Wave–style vocal mixing, mastering, and production with piano, synthesizer, and guitar.
